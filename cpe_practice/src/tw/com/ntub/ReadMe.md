# Problem E - Parity
## Time Limit: 1 second

### We define the parity of an integer n as the sum of the bits in binary representation computed modulo two. As an example, the number 21 = 101012 has three 1s in its binary representation so it has parity 3 (mod 2), or 1. 

### In this problem you have to calculate the parity of an integer 1 ≤ I ≤ 2147483647. 

## Input
### Each line of the input has an integer I and the end of the input is indicated by a line where I = 0 that should not be processed. 

## Output
### For each integer I in the inputt you should print a line The parity of B is P (mod 2)., where B is the binary representation of I. 

## Sample Input
1<br>
2<br>
10<br>
21<br>
0<br>

## Sample Output
The parity of 1 is 1 (mod 2).<br>
The parity of 10 is 1 (mod 2).<br>
The parity of 1010 is 2 (mod 2).<br>
The parity of 10101 is 3 (mod 2).

# Odd Sum  

## Given a range [a, b], you are to find the summation of all the odd integers in this range. For example, the summation of all the odd integers in the range [3, 9] is 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 24. 
## Input  
### There can be at multiple test cases. The first line of input gives you the number of test cases, T ( 1$ \le$T$ \le$100). Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of 2 integers a and b ( 0$ \le$a$ \le$b$ \le$100) in two separate lines. 
## Output  
### For each test case you are to print one line of output - the serial number of the test case followed by the summation of the odd integers in the range [a, b]. 
## Sample Input  
2<br>
1<br>
5<br>
3<br>
5<br>

## Sample Output  
Case 1: 9<br>
Case 2: 8<br>




# Hashmat the brave warrior 

## Input: standard input

## Output: standard output

 

### Hashmat is a brave warrior who with his group of young soldiers moves from one place to another to fight against his opponents. Before fighting he just calculates one thing, the difference between his soldier number and the opponent's soldier number. From this difference he decides whether to fight or not. Hashmat's soldier number is never greater than his opponent. 



## Input

### The input contains two integer numbers in every line. These two numbers in each line denotes the number of soldiers in Hashmat's army and his opponent's army or vice versa. The input numbers are not greater than 2^32. Input is terminated by End of File.

 

## Output

 ### For each line of input, print the difference of number of soldiers between Hashmat's army and his opponent's army. Each output should be in seperate line.

 

## Sample Input:

10 12 <br>
10 14<br>
100 200<br>

 

## Sample Output:

2 <br>
4<br>
100<br>
